## LINEAR REGRESSION WITH PYTHON Scikit Learn
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

## SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Predict the percentage of student based on the study hours. What will be the predicted score if the student studies for 9.25 hrs per day?
